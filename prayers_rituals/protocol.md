# Sanskrit Translation Protocol

This project uses a standardized Sanskrit Translation Protocol to ensure clarity,
consistency, and transparency in the presentation of Sanskrit source texts.
Each line or verse is translated using the five-part method described below.

---

## 1. Original Sanskrit (Devanāgarī)
The source text is reproduced exactly as it appears, without normalization,
regularization, or emendation unless explicitly noted.

---

## 2. IAST Transliteration
The Sanskrit is transliterated into the International Alphabet of Sanskrit
Transliteration (IAST), preserving vowel length, retroflex consonants, and
diacritics.

---

## 3. Word-by-Word Breakdown
Each word is analyzed with:
- its **base form (lexeme)**  
- **grammatical information**, such as:
  - case, number, gender (for nouns/adjectives/pronouns)
  - person, number, tense, mood, and voice (for verbs)
  - compound classification (tatpuruṣa, bahuvrīhi, karmadhāraya, etc.)
- brief semantic gloss

The purpose is to expose the grammatical structure, not to produce smooth English.

---

## 4. Literal Translation
A close English rendering that follows Sanskrit syntax as much as possible.
Grammatical notes may appear in parentheses.

Example:
> “Rāma (masc. nom. sg.) is the embodiment of righteousness.”

---

## 5. Smooth English Translation
A readable, idiomatic English version conveying natural meaning and flow.

Example:
> “Rāma is the embodiment of righteousness.”

---

## 6. Optional Commentary (if needed)
Brief notes are included only when:
- the Sanskrit requires clarification  
- variants exist  
- interpretation diverges from a literal reading  

Commentary is optional and used sparingly.

---

## Purpose of the Protocol
This protocol:
- preserves philological transparency  
- supports academic and devotional study  
- enables machine-assisted processing (OCR → translation pipeline)  
- harmonizes translations across this repository and future texts  

---

## Example (Full Protocol)

Example Sanskrit line:

देवो नारायणः परः

**Original Sanskrit:**  
देवो नारायणः परः

**IAST:**  
devo nārāyaṇaḥ paraḥ

**Word-by-word:**  
- देवः — m. nom. sg., “god”  
- नारायणः — proper noun, m. nom. sg., “Nārāyaṇa”  
- परः — adjective, m. nom. sg., “supreme, highest”  

**Literal:**  
“God Nārāyaṇa is supreme.”

**Smooth:**  
“Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme Lord.”
